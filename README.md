# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied Correctly

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly, resulting in unexpected styling or missing styles in the rendered HTML.

## Bug Description

The issue is observed in the `bug.js` file, which contains code using Tailwind CSS classes. These classes are not being applied correctly, causing visual discrepancies between the intended and actual output.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the necessary build command (depending on your setup).
3. Observe the rendered output; the styling will not match the classes used.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`, which includes corrections to resolve the styling issues.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Ensure that the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or similar) is correctly set up and points to the correct CSS files.
* **CSS Framework Conflicts:** If you are using other CSS frameworks along with Tailwind CSS, conflicts may arise. Try disabling other frameworks temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.
* **Build Process Issues:** Problems with the build process (e.g., webpack, Parcel) can prevent Tailwind CSS from correctly processing the classes. Review your build configuration and ensure that the necessary plugins and loaders are included.
* **PurgeCSS Issues:** If PurgeCSS is used, double-check whether it's configured correctly and has not mistakenly removed necessary classes.
* **Typographical Errors:** Carefully review the class names in your HTML for any typos or incorrect spellings. 
* **Caching:** Clear browser and build caches to eliminate outdated styles.
